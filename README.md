## Short Description

**Flow Field Painter** is an interactive generative project built in Unity that explores flow fields, noise, and particle systems. A noise-driven vector field defines directional forces across the screen, guiding the movement of thousands of particles. As the particles move through the field, they leave behind thin trails that slowly accumulate into larger, evolving patterns.

The system is designed to be explored through interaction. Users can reshape the flow field in real time, adjust parameters, and observe how small changes affect the overall motion and structure of the piece. The project focuses on balancing technical systems with visual expression, and on using simple rules to create complex, fluid behavior.
